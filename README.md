UAS Engine
==========

UAS Engine stands for Umplification And Statistics Engine. This project is part of UCOSP Fall 2014. It relies on the [Umple Project](http://www.umple.org), specifically the umplificator component.

UAS Engine automatically umplifies open-source Java projects by reverse engineering them from Java code to Umple code, and collects several statistics about them.
